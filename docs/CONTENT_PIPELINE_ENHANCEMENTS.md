# Content Generation & Pipeline System: Enhancement Roadmap

This document lists actionable tasks for further enhancements to the content generation and pipeline system. Each item is broken down for implementation planning and tracking.

---

## Content Generation Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Options & Controls
- [ ] Allow users to select AI model (e.g., GPT-4, DALL-E, ElevenLabs) per content type
- [ ] Expose advanced parameters (temperature, max tokens, style, voice, etc.) in the UI
- [ ] Enable saving, reusing, and sharing prompt templates

### 2. Content Post-Processing
- [ ] Integrate AI-powered grammar/style suggestions and tone adjustments
- [ ] Add image upscaling and enhancement tools
- [ ] Support multi-step generation workflows (e.g., text → image → audio)
- [ ] Implement content summarization and expansion features

### 3. History, Versioning, and Collaboration
- [ ] Display generation history with restore/compare/versioning
- [ ] Enable team commenting, suggestions, and approvals on generated content
- [ ] Add draft/publish workflow for generated content

### 4. Quality & Safety
- [ ] Integrate AI content moderation for outputs
- [ ] Add plagiarism/originality checking for generated text

### 5. Personalization
- [ ] Support user/brand profiles for voice, style, and preferences
- [ ] Use user feedback (ratings/corrections) to improve future generations

## Pipeline System Enhancements

### 1. Scheduling & Automation
- [ ] Add flexible scheduling (cron, time zones, recurring rules)
- [ ] Support event-based/conditional triggers for pipelines
- [ ] Implement auto-repurposing for different platforms/formats

### 2. Pipeline Templates & Cloning
- [ ] Provide prebuilt pipeline templates for common workflows
- [ ] Enable cloning and importing of pipelines

### 3. Monitoring & Analytics
- [ ] Build a pipeline status dashboard (runs, failures, schedules)
- [ ] Add user notifications for completions, failures, and actions
- [ ] Provide detailed logs for each pipeline run

### 4. Dynamic Inputs & Branching
- [ ] Allow pipelines to accept dynamic variables/inputs
- [ ] Support conditional branching (if/else logic) in pipelines

### 5. Integration & Extensibility
- [ ] Add webhooks and API triggers for pipelines
- [ ] Integrate with third-party tools (CMS, analytics, SaaS)

### 6. Security & Permissions
- [ ] Implement role-based access for pipeline actions
- [ ] Add audit trails for changes and actions

## Social Media Integrations Enhancements

### 1. OAuth2 & Account Management
- [ ] Support additional platforms (Pinterest, Threads, etc.)
- [ ] Unified OAuth2 connect/disconnect UI for all platforms
- [ ] Token refresh and auto-expiry handling
- [ ] Show connected account details (profile, avatar, status)
- [ ] Allow multiple accounts per platform (where supported)

### 2. Posting & Scheduling
- [ ] Unified post composer for all platforms (text, image, video)
- [ ] Platform-specific post previews and validation
- [ ] Bulk and cross-platform posting
- [ ] Scheduled and recurring posts per platform

- [ ] AI-powered suggestions for post timing and content
- [ ] Export analytics data (CSV, PDF)

### 4. Error Handling & Monitoring
- [ ] Retry failed posts with exponential backoff
- [ ] Detailed error logs and user notifications
- [ ] Health/status dashboard for all integrations

### 5. Security & Permissions
